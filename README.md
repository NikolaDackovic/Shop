# 🧸 Shop - React Project

Hey! 👋  
This is my first React project – a small toy shop website.

⚠️ **Work in progress!**  
Right now it's just a skeleton / learning mode. I’m adding features as I learn and experiment with React and CSS.

## 🛠 Technologies
- ⚛️ React.js
- 💻 JavaScript (JSX)
- 🎨 CSS
- 🌐 HTML
- ⚡ Vite

## 🗂 Project structure
- `src/` – main React code and components  
- `public/` – static files (`index.html`)  
- `components/` – reusable components  
- `context/` – React Context for state  
- `assets/images/` – images used in the project  

## 🚀 Planned features
- Product listing  
- Add to cart functionality 🛒  
- Dark/Light mode 🌙☀️  
- Further improvements as I continue learning

## 💡 Note
This repo shows my learning progress in React.  
It will be regularly updated with new features and improvements! ✌️
